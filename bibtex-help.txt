How to write a BibTeX entry for Bebop
-------------------------------------

Bebop plays well with standard BibTeX. With a standard BibTeX code, Bebop will allow you 
out-of-the-box to browse your publications by year, by author; to list them chronologically;
 to export BibTeX codes per publication. However in order to benefit from some additional 
features, you may also fill in the abstract, researcharea, keywords, filelink, presentation and poster fields for 
your publications beside the standard BibTeX fields. This will allow better browsability of 
the publication list such as listing by research area, generation of keyword cloud, displaying
 the abstract and including a link to the full text, slides and poster of the publication. To guarantee that
 publications are ordered properly in time, fill in also the month field if it's absent. 
(In standard BibTeX, month is an optional field.)


How to fill in the researcharea
-------------------------------

Choose one from the list shown under 'by research area' in the main page. This list is specified 
in the bebop configuration file. Pay attention to match the cases and be consistent throughout the
BibTeX file. 

e.g. 
researcharea="System on Chip" (correct) 
researcharea="System on chip" (incorrect) 


How to fill in the keywords
---------------------------

Put a comma(,) in between the keywords. Just for usability, keep all the letters small 
except abbreviations.

e.g. 
keywords="HW/SW co-design, operating systems, high-level synthesis" (correct) 
keywords="HW/SW co-design, Operating systems, High-level synthesis" (incorrect) 

Try to enter 4-5 keywords for each of your publications. It would be great if you could 
try to use same form for same keywords. Keywords are a good way to give the overview of 
the research done. It is possible to see the publications with a specific keyword. 
This allows linking papers with each other. Moreover a keyword cloud (similar to tag 
clouds) is created.

e.g. 
operating systems (correct) 
operating system (incorrect) 
unified modelling language (UML) (correct) 
UML (incorrect) 

How to fill in the filelink, presentation, poster
---------------------------
Give the full path to the file from which the full text, slides and the poster of the publication can be downloaded. 
Beware of copyright issues.

e.g. 
filelink="http://www.alari.ch/publications/files/ABeCe07.pdf"
presentation="http://www.alari.ch/publications/files/ABeCe07_slides.pdf"
poster="http://www.alari.ch/publications/files/ABeCe07_poster.pdf"


How to fill in the month
------------------------

Initial letter of the month is to be written in capital.

e.g. month="March" 
or 
month="March 8-12" 

Note that granularity of sorting in the web page is at the month level, i.e. publications
 are sorted in descending order by their year and month and NOT day. 


How to fill in the BibTeX entry ID
----------------------------------

The BibTeX entry ID has to be unique. Verify this by checking the BibTeX file.

Usual way of choosing an ID is by concatanating first two letters of each author's surname
 and the year of publication (e.g. BoPaSa2007)

However, there is a special rule for our case. Since BibTeX has no dedicated types to specify
 MAS project and Patent, we use the entry ID for this purpose. 

For MS thesis:
    Publication type: mastersthesis
    entry ID ends with MS suffix (e.g. deri06MS)

For MAS project:
    Publication type: mastersthesis
    entry ID ends with MAS suffix (e.g. dani04MAS)

For Patents:
    Publication type: misc
    entry ID ends with PATENT suffix (e.g. BeCe04PATENT)
